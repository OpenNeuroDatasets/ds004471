The London Health Sciences Center Parkinson’s disease (LHSCPD) dataset consists of 40 subjects diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (age: 60.2 ± 6.8, sex: 13 female and 27 male) and have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. 

This release currently contains pre-DBS gadolinium-enhanced imaging collected at our institution (University Hospital in London, ON, Canada) with a 1.5 T scanner (Signa, General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). 

We also release anatomical fiducial (AFIDs) placements on this local dataset. AFIDs placements were performed using 3DSlicer version 4.10.0 on structural T1w images. A total of 5 AFIDs protocol applications were performed (6,400 fiducials).

Ethics approval was received for anonymized release of patient scans by the Human Subject Research Ethics Board (HSREB) office at the University of Western Ontario (REB# 109045).
